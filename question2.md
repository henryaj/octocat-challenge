The 'upstream' remote is usually the one you push to and pull from (particularly the default remote that is used for a ```git push``` or ```git pull``` without arguments). In terms of using GitHub, that makes the remote hosted on GitHub 'upstream' to your local repo (which is itself 'downstream' of the GitHub remote).
